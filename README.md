# Hand-Controlled-Video-Media-Player
This project enables a hand gesture-based control system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. The system detects hand gestures from a webcam feed and simulates corresponding keyboard presses, allowing you to interact with your computer using hand gestures in real-time. It recognizes five specific gestures (one to five fingers)
